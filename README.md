Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel Montserrat and I'm a 32-year-old aspiring front-end developer. I recently discovered my passion for technology and decided to pursue a career in web development.

Although I'm just starting out, I'm eager to learn and committed to improving my skills. I believe that coding is like a puzzle, and I enjoy the process of solving problems and building solutions.

In my free time, I also love practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It helps me stay focused and mentally sharp, and it's a great way to relieve stress and stay in shape.

I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities, so feel free to connect with me and check out my projects. 

Thanks for stopping by!
